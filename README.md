#Election Audit

##Overview of Project

For this week's Python challenge, we have been instructed to generate a vote count report for a U.S congressional precinct in Colorado.  The report takes into account all the votes casted through the three primary voting methods like mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic counting machines.  The report is usually generated in Excel, but we would like to know if there's a way to automate the process using Python.  To do this, phyton code was written and executed to confirm the code was working.  After the report generated through the use of Phyton was submitted, additional data was requested to finalize the audit.  This written report provides a brief overview of the process.
 
###Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to generate a vote count report in Python.

##Election_Audit Results

### *Election Results Printed to the Command Line*


### *Election Results Saved to a Text File*
  
        How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
        Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
        Which county had the largest number of votes?
        
        Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
        Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

        such as voter turn out for each conty, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout in order to finalize and close the audit.   

##Election-Audit Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
